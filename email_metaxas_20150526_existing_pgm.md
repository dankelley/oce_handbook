Bernie,

here are the descriptions of the 2 programs as they will now appear in the calendar. Does this help? 
MSc:


Students must complete OCEA 5000 and an additional 6 credit hours from core courses (5110.03-5140.03); (unless taken as an undergraduate at 4000-level (4110.03-4140.03) with minimum grade of A or 5000-level as advanced placement). Additional courses may be required to strengthen a student’s background in basic science. Research and a thesis are required.

PhD:

Students must complete at least 12 credit hours at 5000-level or higher of OCEA courses (OCGY 5000 does not  count towards          this requirement), 9 of which from core courses (5110.03-5140.03) (with MSc from Dal Oceanography: core courses taken at MSc can be waived for the PhD requirement; with MSc from other departments or institutions: core course equivalencies will be assessed on case by case). Additional courses may be required to strengthen a student’s background in basic science. Candidates are expected to meet an extra qualifying criterion. Consult the Oceanography Graduate Handbook for details. Candidates must write and defend a proposal for thesis research. Research and a thesis are required.



Cheers
Anna
