The markings on these documents were made by DK, during meetings of the
Graduate Oversight Committee. He generally read the notes out as he was writing
them, and only made such notes after the committee reached consensus. The notes
are not at a sufficiently detailed level to hand to a typist, since developing
such material would have stretched meetings out insufferably. In many cases,
the decision was simply that DK should rewrite material.
