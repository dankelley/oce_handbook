* `OceanographyGradHandbook13-14.docx` original source document

* `oce_handbook.tex` latex version, with these tagged stepping stones:
    - `d01` first latex version, with (a) contact section deleted, (b) 'what is this doc' section deleted,
    all FGS links fixed, (c) a few items indexed (mainly to see if this might be useful)
    - `d02` -- will be after doing the edits suggested at the GOC discussion meeting
